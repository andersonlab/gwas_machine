# gwas_machine
Platform to run GWAS machinery within the Anderson lab. This will be a 'soup-to-nuts' target identification operation and will include all ingredients necessary to transform the raw genotype data coming into the Anderson lab into high quality imputed data which will be used for GWAS and post-GWAS functional analysis to delve into potential therapeutic targets.
